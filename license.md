## Choosing a license
An open source license guarantees that others can use, copy, modify, and contribute back to your project without repercussions. It also protects you from sticky legal situations. You must include a license when you launch an open source project.  When licensing your project, keep in mind that someone who makes a derivative of your hardware will probably also want to build on your software, instructions, and other documentation; you should license not just the hardware design files but also these other elements of your project.

Legal work can be confusing, so adding one of these existing licenses to your repo greatly simplifies things. There are two ways you can include a license in your repo.

### How to add a license with GitHub:
When you create a new project on GitHub, you are given the option to select a license. You can also copy and paste an existing license into your repository as a LICENSE.txt file. It will only take a minute to protect your hard work.

It is good practice to include a copy of the license in the version control repository, and a statement in every file or at least the README specifying the author(s) and year(s) of non-trivial modifications, and the license.
